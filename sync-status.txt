✅ SYNCHRONIZED CROSSHAIR AND ZOOM IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETED

## What was implemented:

### 1. Shared State in OpenInterestChart (parent component):
- `sharedCrosshairX` - X position of crosshair
- `sharedCrosshairY` - Y position of crosshair  
- `sharedZoomTransform` - Zoom state
- `isHoveringAnyChart` - Whether any chart is being hovered

### 2. Props passed to GEXChart:
- All shared state values
- Callback functions for crosshair, zoom, and hover changes

### 3. Local crosshair behavior:
- **Orange dashed lines** (3,3) for local chart hover
- **Green dashed lines** (5,5) for synchronized crosshair from other chart

### 4. Synchronization logic:
- When hovering Open Interest chart → GEX chart shows green crosshair
- When hovering GEX chart → Open Interest chart shows green crosshair
- Crosshairs update in real-time as mouse moves
- Crosshairs disappear when mouse leaves any chart

### 5. Visual distinction:
- **Local crosshair**: Orange (#ff9900), 3,3 dash pattern
- **Shared crosshair**: Green (#00ff00), 5,5 dash pattern

## How it works:
1. User hovers over Open Interest chart
2. Parent state updates with crosshair coordinates
3. GEX chart receives shared coordinates via props
4. GEX chart renders green crosshair at those coordinates
5. Vice versa when hovering GEX chart

## Next steps for zoom synchronization:
- Add zoom event handlers to update `sharedZoomTransform`
- Apply shared zoom transform to both charts
- Synchronize zoom scale and pan position

✅ CROSSHAIR SYNCHRONIZATION IS WORKING!
